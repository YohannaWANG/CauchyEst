- (TODO) For distributions generated by degree 10 Bayes network, run our three algorithms with d=5. See how fast the errors converge.
- (TODO) Real datasets from bnlearn
- (TODO) Ill-conditioned models. Like say one of the variables has noise variance very close to 0. Hopefully, here we can also find some difference between CauchyEst and CauchyEstGeneral;
- (TODO) some fraction have  N = r.normal(scale = 10^-10) others have N = r.normal(scale = 1.0) as before;
- (TODO) for each server job, try running on "1 algorithm, 1 parameter setting, X samples". that way you can parallelize quite a lot and you can plot each graph line (with error bars) as soon as one of these jobs complete.
```



## config.py (updated)
Set parameters for Bayesian network (eg. node number, graph degree, sample size)

## utils.R
```diff
+ Load bnlearn graph;
+ CLIME algorithm;
+ TIGER algorithm.
```
